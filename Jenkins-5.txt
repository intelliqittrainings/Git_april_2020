Setting up of a slave for Jenkins Master/Slave concept
=======================================================
1 Create a new AWS ubuntu18 instance
2 Name it Slave1
3 Install the same version of Java that we installed on master
  a) Update the apt repoistory
     sudo apt-get update
  b) Install java
     sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk
4) Setup Passwordless ssh between Master and Slave
   a) Set password for default "ubuntu" user
      sudo passwd ubuntu
   b) Edit sshd_config file
      sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      Search for "PasswordAuthentication" and change it from no to yes
   c) Restart ssh
      sudo service ssh restart
   d) Connect to Master (JenkinsServer) using gitbash
   e) Generate the ssh keys
      ssh-keygen
      This command will generate 2 keys caled private and public keys in the
      .ssh folder
   f) Copy the keys
      ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private_ip_slave
      This will copy the content of the the public keys and paste in a file 
      called authorised_keys on the slave.Once these keys are copied
      we will be able to perfrom Passwordless shh from Master to slave

5 Connet to Slave using gitbash
6 Download slave.jar
  wget http://private_ip_of_master:8080/jnlpJars/slave.jar
7 Give execute permissions for this slave.jar
  chmod u+x slave.jar
8 Create an empty folder which will act as workspace for jenkins
  mkdir workspace
9 Open the dashboard of Jenkins--->Click on Manage Jenkins
10 Click on Manage Node and Clouds
11 Click on New Node
12 Enter some node name--->Select Permanant Agent--->Ok














    ssh ubuntu@172.31.11.119     java -jar slave.jar
